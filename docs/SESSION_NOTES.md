pnpm install          # Install dependencies
pnpm test             # Run calculator tests (301 tests)
pnpm build            # Build all packages
pnpm dev              # Start dev server (apps/web)
pnpm test:e2e         # Run Playwright E2E tests

## Future Ideas

- **Recommendation Summary** - Add weighted scoring to Compare Mode
- **Accounting Treatment Comparison** - Journal entries side-by-side in Compare Mode
- **Rename "intercompany" folders** - Rename to `transactions/` (low priority)
